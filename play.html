          <h2>Millet Mohan: Embracing Sustainable Farming</h2>
          <p>
            A powerful and evocative stage play, Rishi Das' original work,
            "Millet Mohan." Set in pre-independence India, the play takes the
            audience on a journey from the past to the present, emphasizing the
            importance of preserving traditional agricultural practices and
            embracing sustainable farming for a better future. The play's
            timeless message is not only relevant to farmers but also resonates
            with audiences from all walks of life, encouraging a deeper
            understanding of the challenges faced by the agricultural sector
            today. "Millet Mohan" serves as an educational tool, showcasing the
            potential of traditional crops and sustainable farming practices to
            address contemporary ecological and socio-economic challenges. The
            play also makes sure to mention the various government initiatives
            already in place to help farmers in India, directing the audience to
            where they can find these resources, thereby providing practical
            support for farmers and their communities. By integrating this
            production into school curriculums across India, students will
            develop a profound appreciation for their cultural heritage and the
            wisdom of their ancestors whilst also giving the students an
            opportunity to showcase their talents on stage. This play will
            inspire students to become advocates for a sustainable future,
            equipped with the knowledge and passion to contribute to the
            preservation and revitalization of India's rich agricultural
            traditions.
