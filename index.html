          <h2>Millets : The Nutri-cereals</h2>
          <p>
            Millets are collective group of small seeded annual grasses that are
            grown as grain crops, primarily on marginal land in dry areas of
            temperate, sub tropical and tropical regions.
          </p>
          <h2>International Year of Millets (IYoM)-2023</h2>
          <p>
            Government of India had proposed to United Nations for declaring
            2023 as International Year of Millets (IYOM). The proposal of India
            was supported by 72 countries and United Nation’s General Assembly
            (UNGA) declared 2023 as International Year of Millets on 5th March,
            2021. Now, Government of India has decided to celebrate IYOM, 2023
            to make it peoples’ movement so that the Indian millets, recipes,
            value added products are accepted globally.

          <h2>Why this Movement?</h2>
          <p>
            The United Nations, at the behest of the Government of India,
            declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets to increase
            public awareness on the health benefits of millets and their
            suitability for cultivation under tough conditions marked by climate
            change. The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution
            sponsored by India and supported by more than 70 countries,
            declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets.

              “Raising awareness to create 'Millet Mindfulness' is an important
              part of this movement. Both institutions and individuals can make
              a tremendous impact. I am positive that the International Year of
              Millets 2023 will start a mass movement towards a secure,
              sustainable and healthy future.”
